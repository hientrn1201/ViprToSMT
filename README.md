<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I develop a parser in Rust to verify the correctness of solutions generated by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers based on [this paper](https://github.com/zhoum929/Satisfiability-modulo-theories-for-verifying-MILP-certificates/blob/main/main.pdf) with some substantial modifications:

- Written in Rust
- Introduced new algorithms to check derived constraints in a recurrence style to avoid Memory Limit Exception from SMT solver software
- Further check the validity of the VIPR certificate using SMT-COQ plugin from CVC4 (in progress)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and Installation

For this program to run, please install

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Any SMT solver software, e.g. [cvc5](https://cvc5.github.io/docs/cvc5-1.0.0/installation/installation.html), [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), [cvc4](https://cvc4.github.io/downloads.html)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### 1. Original Examples from VIPR paper

All experiments in the original VIPR paper are conducted using this project. You can find the details in the original [VIPR paper's experiments section](https://github.com/ambros-gleixner/VIPR/blob/master/experiments/README.md).

For all of the above experiments, I introduced 2 scripts, one for downloading all the experiments and one for running the test and output the results in a csv file.

- To download test cases, run `./download_test.sh`
- To run test cases, run `./run_test.sh <block_size> <software>` where
  - `block_size` is the number of derived constraints to be checked each time
  - `software` is the SMT solver software of your choice

### 2. Run your own VIPR file

If you want to do test your own problems, please refer to [SCIP-extension](https://github.com/leoneifler/exact-SCIP).

Once you get your .vipr file, you can run the following command

```
cargo run -- -f <file_path> -m <block_size> -s <software>
```

where

- `file_path` is the path of your .vipr file
- `block_size` is the number of derived constraints to be checked each time
- `software` is the SMT solver software of your choice
